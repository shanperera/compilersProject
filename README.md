# Compilers Project

For Computer Science 4TB3 -Syntax Based Tools and Compilers- we had to design a final project related to compiler construction. Our project topic involved teaching Finite State Machine minimization using an algorithm of our choice and presenting it through a Jupyter notebook.

The purpose of the project was to find a way to teach the topic of finite state machine minimization using a more hands-on approach. This is done using the Jupyter notebook, the notebook will teach all the basic knowledge necessary to perform finite state minimization. After learning the basics, the notebook will allow students to test their understanding through code examples embedded directly within the notebook itself. The notebook also includes visualizations and animations of the minimization algorithm which is presented during the evaluation itself.

## Install on a Machine
1) Please refer to the documentation on the Jupyter website for help with installation: http://jupyter.org/install.html
2) After installation, download the TeachingCompilers.ipynb file to your machine
3) Run Jupyter Notebooks and open the TeachingCompilers.ipynb

##  Run the Notebook Online
Sign in with a Microsoft account (I used my decade old Hotmail account) and upload the TeachingCompilers.ipynb file to the server and run the notebook online.

## Note
When running the notebook for the first time, make sure to run the cells with the code blocks, this can be done by clicking on the code block, and pressing the "Run" button on the toolbar in the Jupyter Notebooks interface, or simply pressing "Run All" instead.
