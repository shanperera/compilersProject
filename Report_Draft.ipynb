This project will covers following two aspects: \n1. **Minimizing the number of states in Deterministic Finite State Machine (DFA)**\n2. **Transform Non Deterministic Finite State Machine (NFA) to Deterministic Finite State Machine (DFA)**\n\nIt is very important to understand finite state machines when learning about compilers. Compilers are often built using a finite state machine to encode the current state and actions as well as transitions to other states. \n### Overview\nThis project will teach users about the algorithms for **state minimization** and **covering NFA to DFA**. The following flow chart demonstrates the structure of this project. \n<img src=\"flowchart.png\">\n\n### Required Tools\nThe software tools needed for this project: \n1. Jupyter Notebook \n2. Python 3\n\n### Supporting OS\nSince the project is built on Jupyter Notebook, it supports multiple operating systems including: \n- Windows \n- Mac OS \n- Linux\n\n### Implementation Outline\nThe implementation plan are shown in the table below.\n\n| No. | Task | Owner | Date          \n| :---: | :-------------: |:-------------: | :---: \n| 1 | Reserch on state minimization algorithm | Danielle Shwed | March 10\n| 2 | Reserch on converting NFA to DFA algorithm | Xiaoying Wang | March 10\n| 3 | Research on Visualization in Jupyter Notebook | Liyanage Perera | March 10\n| 4 | Text explanation of algorithms  | Danielle Shwed | March 20\n| 5 | Visualization  | Liyanage Perera | March 20\n| 6 | Documentation - draft report  | Xiaoying Wang | March 20\n| 7 | Implementation of state minimization algorithm | TBD | April 6\n| 8 | Implementation of converting NFA to DFA algorithm | TBD | April 6\n| 9 | Implementation of additional visual effects required for this project | TBD | April 6\n| 10 | Documentation - final report | TBD | April 6\n| 11 | Presentation | All | TBD\n\n", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}], "nbformat": 4, "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3", "name": "python3", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"mimetype": "text/x-python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "version": "3.5.1", "name": "python", "file_extension": ".py", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "codemirror_mode": {"version": 3, "name": "ipython"}}}}
